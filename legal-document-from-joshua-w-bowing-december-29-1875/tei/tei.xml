                    <p xml:id='OTPS32079669P0'>Peter Crosby was an African American sheriff in Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32079669P1'>Born a slave in Clarke County, Mississippi, in 1844, Crosby was liberated during the Civil War and joined the Fifth U.S. Colored Heavy Artillery in Vicksburg in 1864. Following the Civil War, he became active in local political matters, participating in Republican Party meetings, and seeking election for public office, serving as constable of Yazoo City in the late 1860s and then treasurer of Warren County in 1873. In November 1873, Crosby won election for sheriff of Warren County. However, conservative white Democrats contested his electoral victory and on December 2, 1874, a large group of armed men forced him to resign. A few days later, on December 7, 1874, several Black protesters held a gathering in front of the Warren County Courthouse in support of Crosby’s reinstatement as sheriff. They were confronted by several white conservatives, and gunfire soon erupted. The fight was heavily one-sided, with one white man and twenty-five Black men killed in the affair. The incident was referred to by some as the Vicksburg riots, but has largely been recognized as the Vicksburg Massacre.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPS32079669P2'>The incident drew attention of federal authorities, and President Ulysses S. Grant sent soldiers to Vicksburg to reinstate order. Federal troops under General Philip Sheridan returned Crosby to the office of sheriff, but not before additional attacks by conservative whites took the lives of as many as three hundred Black Mississippians in January 1875. Once again serving as sheriff, Crosby appointed J. P. Gilmer as a deputy. On June 7, 1875, Gilmer shot Crosby in the head in an apparent assassination attempt. While Crosby survived, he never fully recovered from the wound and was unable to continue his role as sheriff. Gilmer was arrested for the assault, but was never tried or convicted. Crosby died on March 15, 1884. (Wikipedia; <hi rend='italic'>The Clarion-Ledger</hi>, Jackson, MS, June 9, 1870; Trudy Lee Wright, “Peter Crosby [1844-1884],” February 10, 2023, Black Past)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32075543P0'>This subject tag includes references to various and unidentified state and local elections held within Mississippi. During the Civil War, most Mississippians supported secession and the Confederacy and therefore voted in favor of policies and for candidates dedicated to those causes. After the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865, President Andrew Johnson instituted a lenient Reconstruction policy that offered amnesty to individuals who took an oath of loyalty to the United States (with exceptions for certain upper-class southerners). This policy allowed many former Confederates to run for office shortly after the end of the war and pass legislation designed to limit the rights of freed African Americans, known as the Black Codes. Restrictions against black political rights led Republicans in the U.S. Congress to take a firmer hand in Mississippi’s Reconstruction and protect Black rights. Between 1867 and 1876, Republicans backed by federal soldiers struggled to ensure Black Mississippians had equal voting rights and could run for office.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32075543P1'>Many white southern conservatives, however, used threats and violence to prevent Black Mississippians and white Republicans from voting, or influence the results of elections. These efforts reached a peak in 1874 under the “Mississippi Plan,” which began with a systematic effort to disenfranchise Black voters in Mississippi and evict African American and Republican office holders. As many as three hundred Black people were killed in Vicksburg in the racial violence. President Ulysses S. Grant sent federal troops to Vicksburg to enforce the law, but soldiers were unable to change the political climate within the state. White Democrats organized under the Mississippi Plan suppressed Black and Republican voters enough to dominate state elections in 1875 by 30,000 votes. Reconstruction ended in 1877 with white conservatives still in command of Mississippi’s state and local politics.

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32084955P0'>Voting is the activity of choosing someone or something in an election. The United States Constitution left the states with the responsibility of managing elections, leading to a wide variety of voting practices. Initially, the two most common forms of voting in the United States involved voice vote and paper ballots. Most paper ballots during the early nineteenth century through the Civil War involved “party tickets,” which included the names of candidates of only one party. The voter provided the ballot to election officials, meaning voting was a public display of the voter’s selection. This practice made voters more susceptible to public pressure or intimidation during contentious elections or in communities dominated by one political party. During Reconstruction, some communities began using blank ballots, also known as the “Australian ballot,” which provided more secrecy for voters.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32084955P1'>During the Civil War, many northern states began changing voting practices to account for the thousands of men in the Union army and away from home. Before the war, only Pennsylvania allowed soldiers to vote by mail-in or absentee ballots. The election of 1864 was the first time since 1812 that a presidential election occurred during a war. With so many residents on the war front, between 1862 and 1864 twenty northern states passed laws to grant their soldiers the right to vote through mail-in ballots. The issue was contentious, in part because many Democrats argued that Republican officials would tamper with the military votes. Democrats were also more aligned with anti-war sentiment and opposition to emancipation of African Americans. Many Democrats feared that frontline soldiers would boost electoral support for the President Abraham Lincoln’s reelection. Indeed, most Union soldiers voted for Lincoln, helping secure his reelection.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32084955P2'>Voting rights changed dramatically in the South after the Civil War. Federal Reconstruction laws prohibited former Confederates from voting until they took a loyalty oath, or, in some cases, appealed to President Andrew Johnson personally. Many ex-Confederates undertook these steps and managed to regain voting rights and run for office shortly after the war. These white officials passed highly discriminatory laws, starting with Mississippi in late 1865, known as the “Black Codes,” which restricted African American rights. Republicans in the U.S. Congress then implemented more oversight in Reconstruction and better protected Black civil rights including the right to vote. This included the passage and ultimate ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibited states from denying any person the right to vote based upon race, color, or previous condition of servitude. These protections only covered men, as women were still not allowed to vote in most elections in most states. As a result, African Americans played a large part in southern elections, boosting Republican Party success and leading to African American politicians winning seats in local, state, and national offices. Conservative white voters in the South responded by engaging in voter suppression through violence and intimidation. The “Mississippi Plan” in 1875 was one such effort, which led to a dramatic drop in Republican votes, leading to the Democratic Party takeover of Mississippi’s state legislature.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32084955P3'>The end of Reconstruction in 1877 led to a new wave of restrictions against Black voting in the South. Many southern states began implementing poll taxes, literacy tests, and the “grandfather clause” designed to disenfranchise African American voters. Many southern Blacks could not afford the poll taxes or were not literate enough to pass voter reading requirements. The “grandfather clause” prohibited voting for anyone whose grandfather had not been eligible to vote, a policy aimed directly at the descendants of the formerly enslaved. These laws lasted well into the twentieth century. (Cambridge Dictionary, Smithsonian Institute, National Geographic, Wikipedia, National Archives and Records Administration)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD32079669P0'>Peter Crosby was an African American sheriff in Mississippi during the Reconstruction era.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32079669P1'>Born a slave in Clarke County, Mississippi, in 1844, Crosby was liberated during the Civil War and joined the Fifth U.S. Colored Heavy Artillery in Vicksburg in 1864. Following the Civil War, he became active in local political matters, participating in Republican Party meetings, and seeking election for public office, serving as constable of Yazoo City in the late 1860s and then treasurer of Warren County in 1873. In November 1873, Crosby won election for sheriff of Warren County. However, conservative white Democrats contested his electoral victory and on December 2, 1874, a large group of armed men forced him to resign. A few days later, on December 7, 1874, several Black protesters held a gathering in front of the Warren County Courthouse in support of Crosby’s reinstatement as sheriff. They were confronted by several white conservatives, and gunfire soon erupted. The fight was heavily one-sided, with one white man and twenty-five Black men killed in the affair. The incident was referred to by some as the Vicksburg riots, but has largely been recognized as the Vicksburg Massacre.
</p>

<p xml:id='OTPSD32079669P2'>The incident drew attention of federal authorities, and President Ulysses S. Grant sent soldiers to Vicksburg to reinstate order. Federal troops under General Philip Sheridan returned Crosby to the office of sheriff, but not before additional attacks by conservative whites took the lives of as many as three hundred Black Mississippians in January 1875. Once again serving as sheriff, Crosby appointed J. P. Gilmer as a deputy. On June 7, 1875, Gilmer shot Crosby in the head in an apparent assassination attempt. While Crosby survived, he never fully recovered from the wound and was unable to continue his role as sheriff. Gilmer was arrested for the assault, but was never tried or convicted. Crosby died on March 15, 1884. (Wikipedia; <hi rend='italic'>The Clarion-Ledger</hi>, Jackson, MS, June 9, 1870; Trudy Lee Wright, “Peter Crosby [1844-1884],” February 10, 2023, Black Past)

              <gloss><p xml:id='OTPSD51788P0'>Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <hi rend='italic'>Mississippi</hi>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)
