Charleston Miss, Jan 17th/61.

Dear Sir:

There are a number of gentle-men in this county, who desire to form themselves into a cavalry company to be ready with their services to [?] the exigencies of the the Times,

We suppose the state will furnish us with arms which may be necis-serry. We wish to form and commence drilling immediately so as to render ourselves acquainted with Caval-ry tactics As soon as may be necessa-ry we intend to offer our services to the State.

What we desire is to be furnished with arms necessary for such a company, we furnish ourselves with every thing else, uniform, horses

Any information as to how to proceed we will be thankful to your Excellency for.

Your obdt subt.

H. J. Harper

To his Excellency
Gov. John J. Pettus
Jackson
Miss






H. J. Harper of Charleston
