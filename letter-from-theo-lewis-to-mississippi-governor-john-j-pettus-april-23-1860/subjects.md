*Pettus, John Jones, 1813-1867* (ID: 63111): John Jones Pettus was Mississippi's governor during the first three years of the Civil War.  

Born in Wilson County, Tennessee, on October 9, 1813, Pettus moved to Limestone County, Alabama, as a child. In 1835, he  moved to Mississippi and eventually began a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi. He married Permelia Winston in the 1840s. She passed away in 1857, and in 1861 Pettus married Susan Hewell.

Pettus began pursuing a political career in the mid-1840s, first serving as a state representative for Kemper County. He won a state Senate election in 1848 and by 1853 had risen to president of the Mississippi Senate. Then, in January 1854, Governor Henry S. Foote resigned in protest before Governor-elect John J. McRae was inaugurated. Pettus’ position in the Senate placed him next in line to fill the governor’s vacancy, and he was sworn in as Mississippi’s interim executive on January 7, 1854. He served in that role for only three days, before McRae was inaugurated on January 10.

Pettus won the governor’s election in 1859. By that time, he had become a notable secessionist. He advocated for the creation of an independent Confederacy dedicated to preserving slavery. When Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, Pettus called forth a special legislative session in Mississippi and pressed state representatives to hold a secession convention. His efforts succeeded, as such convention assembled in January 1861 and voted in support of secession, declaring the State of Mississippi out of the Union. Pettus won reelection for governor in 1861 and served until his term ended in 1863. Mississippi’s Constitution had a two-term limit for the governor’s office, leaving Pettus unable to run again. He took a commission as a colonel in the Mississippi State Troops and served until the end of the war. Shortly thereafter, Pettus moved to Arkansas. He applied for a presidential pardon according to President Andrew Johnson’s Reconstruction policies, but was denied three times. 

Pettus died of pneumonia on January 25, 1867. He is buried in Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

*Confederate States of America--War Department. Ordnance Department* (ID: 25013536): The Confederate Ordnance Bureau was the office responsible for acquiring ammunition and weapons for the Confederate military. Technically a branch of the Corps of Artillery, the Ordnance Bureau operated independently and was commanded by Major Josiah Gorgas, who had resigned from the United States Ordnance Department at the start of the Civil War. Gorgas estimated that the Confederacy had fewer than 160,000 small arms and only 429 cannons (375 of which were in fortifications around Charleston) in early 1861. To increase the number of weapons and ammunition, the Ordnance Bureau relied upon three sources: European imports, domestic manufacturing, and battlefield captures. The bureau also labored to provide weapons and ammunition to the field armies through railroad and wagon train transportation routes. Through these efforts, and despite the Union blockade and limited domestic resources, the Ordnance Bureau imported around 380,000 foreign small arms, produced around 10,000 firearms within the Confederacy, and captured enough Union weapons to arm the Confederate military throughout the war. The Confederate army never suffered a battlefield defeat due to the lack of weapons or ammunition. (Frank E. Vandiver, “Makeshifts of Confederate Ordnance,” <i>The Journal of Southern History</i>, 180–193; Philip Leigh, “Civil War Ordnances Bureaus,” Essential Civil War Curriculum) 

*Mississippi--Warren County. Vicksburg* (ID: 51788): Located in Warren County, Mississippi, Vicksburg was founded under the name Fort Nogales as early as 1790 in what was then unincorporated territory. In 1798, upon creation of Mississippi Territory, it was renamed Walnut Hills. On April 1, 1799, Walnut Hills became part of the newly created Pickering County (later renamed Jefferson County on January 10, 1802), until the creation of Claiborne County on January 26, 1802. It then became part of its current county of Warren on December 21, 1809. Upon its incorporation on January 29th, 1825, it was renamed Vicksburg. Vicksburg became the county seat in 1836 and remains today. (Rowland, <i>Mississippi</i>, 858; Wikipedia; Britannica; Atlas of Historical County Boundaries)
