<p>which I suppose will be properly accounted for by persons who have I on deposit when they render their a/c against the distillery.  Schedule C shows the names of individuals to whom the distillery is indebted for Supplies of corn, provisions, labor &amp; C which according to the best information I can get will amount to about thirty one thousand dollars $31,000<sup>00</sup></p>

<p>Schedule D is a list of property taken possession of by me under instructions from Your Excellency.</p>

<p>The original Vouchers and all papers found at the distillery or in possession of Maj. Strong are now in my hands and will bring or Send them to you when you desire it necessary. <br/>
I you deem it necessary or expedient I will upon your instructions, call on the creditors of the distillery for their a/c that is provided I am authorized to Settle with them in Some manner or that you think there is a chance of their getting something for their claims ultimately.</p>

Tis possible that Maj. Strong knows but I find no memorandum of Such loss.</p>

<p>All of which is respectfully submitted for your Consideration—</p>

<p>Yours Respectfully</p>
